# Text-based terminal rpg battle template

This was a simple little project that I decided to make for use in potential future projects, but I'm also putting it here in case anybody wants to either use it themselves, or optomize it, or anything.
This is completely open source, so go crazy! Just make sure to credit me (Fable7122 on github)
